Offered to the market with no onward chain.   Planning permission has been granted for the creation of a first floor alongside a single storey rear extension to create a four/five bedroom two-storey property - planning ref: 24/01193/FUL. There is also the potential for the site to be split to create a separate, second dwelling - subject to relevant permissions being approved (initial conversations with the council have been favourable thus far - please ask for further details).  As it stands, the property measures just shy of 2000 sq.ft and whilst it would benefit from some cosmetic refurbishment it is a very good sized bungalow.   The current layout comprises an entrance lobby leading to a main hallway off which there is a lovely dual aspect reception room, a kitchen/breakfast room, a separate dining room which in turn leads to a conservatory, a master bedroom complete with en-suite four piece bathroom comprising a bath, separate shower, w/c and wash hand basin. The second bedroom also has the added benefit of an en-suite shower room whilst also leading to a small study which benefits from an integral door to the garage. A further third bedroom and family shower room complete the internal accommodation.   To the side of the property there is off-street parking available for two cars which in turn leads to a double garage. There is the possibility to create further parking to the front of the property next to the existing driveway. The front garden is currently mainly lawned with a pedestrian footpath from the road leading to the front door with a paved area running the width of the front of the bungalow and leading down to the side. An enclosed garden to the rear comprises a full width patio and paved area, the side area housing a shed, with a lawned area complemented by a selection of mature shrubs and bushes. The garden then pushes down to the side of the property creating a large, enclosed lawned area, again complemented by a selection of trees, shrubs and bushes. The total size of the garden means that should a buyer carry out the existing plans granted and create the second floor, the property would still have a generous garden for the overall square footage of the property. It could also  potentially be split off to create any second dwelling (again, subject to relevant permissions). As it stands, it also presents an unusual opportunity to the more green fingered amongst us with the potential to create a stunning garden whilst keeping the property single storey. Edwalton Lodge Cl is a quiet cul-de-sac set just off Melton Rd within easy reach of a wide range of local amenities, Edwalton Village itself is just on the other side of Melton Rd with central West Bridgford a short drive away, also made easier by the regular bus service running along Melton Rd making both West Bridgford and Nottingham City Centre easily accessible.", "has_video_tour": false, "has_brochure": true, "has_floorplan": true, "scraped_at": "2025-10-23T19:18:57.853340+00:00"}
